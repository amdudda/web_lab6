I found the pure CSS to be simplest.  JavaScript was kind of a pain to figure out, because I needed to query specific CSS elements.  I also learned that using for...in loops on arrays doesn't really work.  I think the JQuery would be the best best for large pages with lot of dynamic formatting.  CSS works great for static formatting, and is relatively easy to implement.  I'd save JavaScript for small pages or stuff where load speed is more important than reliable layout, because it's fussy and difficult to debug.
